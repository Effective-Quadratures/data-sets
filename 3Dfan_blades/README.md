This dataset contains aerodynamic data for three Rolls-Royce research fan blades. This data is shared with permission from Rolls-Royce plc. For blade there is a design of experiment with inputs, which denote the 3D design parameters, and outputs, which correspond to the non-dimensional pressure ratio and non-dimensional efficiency values.
